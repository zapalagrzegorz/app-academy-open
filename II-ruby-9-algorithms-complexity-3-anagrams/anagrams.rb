# Anagrams

# Our goal today is to write a method that determines if two given words are anagrams. This means that the letters in one word can be rearranged to form the other word. For example:

# anagram?("gizmo", "sally")    #=> false
# anagram?("elvis", "lives")    #=> true

# Assume that there is no whitespace or punctuation in the given strings.
