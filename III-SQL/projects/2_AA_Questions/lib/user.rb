# Average Karma is pretty tough. Here are some hints:

#     I used a LEFT OUTER JOIN to combine the questions and question_likes table.
#         You need questions so you can filter by the author, and you need question_likes so you can count the number of likes.
#     I used a COUNT(DISTINCT(...)) to count the number of questions.
#         Note that a question that is liked multiple times will be repeated in the joined table.
#     I used a COUNT(column) to count the number of non-NULL entries in a column.
#         Note that a question that is never liked will take up one row in the joined table. How do we use COUNT(column) to not count this toward the total number of likes?

# Next, divide the number of likes by the number of questions. Because COUNT returns two integers, and because integer division rounds down (3 / 2 == 1), we need to CAST one of the numbers to FLOAT. We can do this like so: CAST(value AS FLOAT).
